# NENA Messaging Features

This document outlines the features to be implemented in the NENA messaging application.

## Core Communication Features

- [ ] Messaging: Send text, voice messages, GIFs, stickers, photos, and documents.
- [ ] Media Sharing: Easily share photos and videos, including the ability to send full-sized photos.

## Advanced Privacy & Security

- [ ] View Once: Send photos and videos that vanish after they've been opened once, perfect for sensitive moments you don't want saved.

- [ ] Phone Notifications: Receive new message alerts directly on your phone.
- [ ] Automatic Drafts: Unfinished messages are saved automatically as drafts.
